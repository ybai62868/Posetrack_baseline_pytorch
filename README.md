# Posetrack_baseline_pytorch
This is a project which contains all of modules
(
image/video-level object detection, 
human pose estimation, 
multiple object tracking
)
used in Posetrack and I will write a tutorial to teach everyone who knows little about deep learning and computer vision to construct an entire posetrack system.

--------------------
In the Posetrack system, there are 3 more important components.
* **image/video object detection.**
* **human pose estimation.**
* **multiple object tracking.**



--------------------
To be continued.
